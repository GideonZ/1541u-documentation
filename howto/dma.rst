DMA loads
---------

The Ultimate is capable of loading files directly into the memory of your C=64. 

This is called DMA load. The menu supports loading files of the .PRG and .P00 types only. 

It doesn’t matter if the PRG is located on the FAT/ISO file system, or inside a disk image (.D64), or inside a tape archive (.T64). Be aware that a lot of programs inside a .D64 file require that the rest of the disk is mounted in the drive. For those programs, use the ‘Mount & Run’ command.
