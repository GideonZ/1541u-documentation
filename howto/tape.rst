TAP
___

The Ultimate products are capable of emulating a cassette tape deck
(CBM1530/1531). To use this function on the Ultimate-II+, a special
adapter set connects the cartridge to the tape port of your C=64
computer. This tape adaptor set can be purchased separately. On the
Ultimate 64, such a cable is not required, as it is built-in.

In order to play a tape, browse in the menu to a .TAP file, and press
enter and select “Play Tape” from the popup menu. This will initialize
the tape streamer from the start of the tape. Use functions in the main
menu (F5) to pause/resume playback. It is also possible to write the
.TAP file to a real tape, using a CBM1530/1531 deck.

Tape signals can also be captured into a .TAP file. The
‘F5’ menu will show you the available options.

T64
___

*How do I use T64 files?*

T64 is a file format, or rather a container, just like D64 disk image. 
Unfortunately the U2 and U2+ do not recognize it as such. 
This means that you cannot open this container using the return key and then choose enter.

Instead, you can use the right cursor key to enter the T64 container and then press return to have the contextual menu pop up and choose run to run the c64 program.

*Applies to: Ultimate 1541-II, Ultimate 1541-II+, Ultimate 64*
