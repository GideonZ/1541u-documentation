Using a real Datasette (Tape recorder)
--------------------------------------

The Ultimate64 can make use of a real Datasette the same way a real C64 can. Just connect it to the tape port and apply the usual commands like LOAD, LOAD"" or shift-run/stop.

**Wrong kernal**
Please note that the wrong kernal, or an activated cartridge probably will cause errors.

If you get the "missing file name error" it will probably be caused by a wrong kernal. If you have doubts if you have flashed the wrong kernal it is recommended that you copy the kernal used by Vice and flash that as the kernal file on your U64.
