With the introduction of firmware 1.18 the behaviour of the LED can be changed.



What does !(option) mean?
-------------------------
As we can see in the table above, there are setting options (functions) that are noted as !(function).
!(function) means it is an inverse outcome of a function.

We take a closer look at the function **DrvAAct+DrvBAct**.
This means when there is drive A or drive B activity (combined) the LED will turn ON.
So **!(DrvAAct+DrvBAct)** will do the opposite (inverse) of the function **DrvAAct+DrvBAct**, so the LED will turn OFF 
when there is activity on drive A or drive B.


Example with two separate LED's
-------------------------------
We are using a red and green LED, red will be the power LED (power) and green will be drive activity (drive).
The power wire to the red led is connected to the Top pin (1) and the green led is connected to the Bottom pin (3), 
and of course the ground of both LED's is connected to the ground pin (2).

Because there are two separate LED's we want that the power is always ON, and the drive will only turn ON when there is activity.

So we use the following setting:

* Power => LED Select Top: **On**
* Drive => LED Select Bottom: **DrvAAct+DrvBAct**

To swap the color assignment, just swap the settings between Top and Bottom.


Example with duo LED
--------------------
We are using a duo LED that has red and green combined in one package, red will be the power LED (power) and green will be drive activity (drive).
The power wire to the red led is connected to the Top pin (1) and the green led is connected to the Bottom pin (3), 
and of course the ground of the LED is connected to the ground pin (2).

Because there is only "one" LED package we want that power will turn OFF when there is drive activity, or else the two colors will be mixed to yellow (red+green).

   :alt: LED setting options

So we use the following setting:

* Power => LED Select Top: **!(DrvAAct+DrvBAct)**
* Drive => LED Select Bottom: **DrvAAct+DrvBAct**

To swap the color assignment, just swap the settings between Top and Bottom.



Technical information
---------------------

**Power LED**

The power pin is provided with a 260KHz PWM signal, the PWM signal makes the LED less bright.
The U64 has an on-board 220 ohms series resistor to lower the current, the supplied voltage 3.3V.

**Drive activity LED**

===  ==========================================
PWM  Description
===  ==========================================
Off  Drive Off
1/3  Drive On
2/3  Drive On + Floppy Mounted
3/3  Drive On + Floppy Mounted + Motor running	
===  ==========================================

*PWM = pulse width of the pwm signal.*
